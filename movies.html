      <h2>Oppenheimer</h2>
      <p><strong>Oppenheimer is a really good movie. It's the first movie I've seen in quite a bit and it's amazing. The cinematography for this movie is so good and i love the way every looks. 
        The acting is also superb.Oppenheimer is a biopic and the movie isn't necessarily about the bomb but more so Oppenheimer and the politics surrounding Oppenheimer during and after the bomb. 
        Another thing i like about this movie is that the "main villain" Lewis Strauss reason for wanting to tear Oppenheimer down and revoke his security clearance was because he thought that Oppenheimer talked bad about him to Einstein
         when in reality they talked about something completely different. This movie is a masterpiece and is one of my favorite movies I've seen I'd give it a 5/5</strong></p>

      <h2>Godzilla Minus One</h2>
      <p><strong>Godzilla Minus one is an amazing movie. This movie is unlike most Godzilla movies. In fact i wouldn't even say its a Godzilla film since it focuses so much on the characters. 
        This movie is more so a movie about ptsd and the horrors of war. This movie is incredible i love the way Godzilla looks and the way everything is shot. 
        One of my favorite scene is when Godzilla uses the atomic breath on the city. Completely destroying it. 
        The acting is incredible and is one of the first movies in a long time to actually make me cry. This movie is great I'm giving it a 5/5</strong> </p>

    <div class="review-text">
      <h2>Lookback</h2>
      <p><strong>Lookback is a manga made by tasuki Fujimoto which then got turned into a film. This movie is incredible it shows what it means to be an artist and to create. 
        And as a person who is making music and likes creating this movie is a pretty good depiction of that. My favorite part of this movie is the animation. 
        The scene here Fujino is running is so well animated and the soundtrack in the background with the piano is so good. 
        Another thing that i like a lot about this movie is the ending. One of the main characters. Kyomoto gets killed. And we see fujino have to deal with the realization that 
        she owes and is reliant on other people. This movie is really good and I'd give it a solid 4/5</strong> </p>

    <div class="review-text">
      <h2>I want to eat your pancreas</h2>
      <p><strong>i want to eat your pancreases is a movie about finding the meaning of being alive. 
        And to me this movie is a great depiction of that. This movie while not being the most complex is still really good. 
        The characters are well written even if the mc isn't the best. But Sakura is a really good character. 
        What i really like about the ending is that she gets killed. it isn't from her disease but from just a random guy. 
        It's realistic almost. This movie is really good and I'd give it a 4/5 </strong> </p>

    <div class="review-text">
      <h2>Oldboy</h2>
      <p><strong>Old boy is a movie that left me thinking about it for days. This movie is one of the best revenge movies I've watched. Up there with the likes of john wick in my opinion. 
      The movie is very gritty and disturbing at times. And i think that adds to it. Hands down the best and worst part of the movie was the plot twist were it gets reviled that the main character Dae-Su slept with his daughter. 
      This plot twist was one of the best plots twists I've seen in a while and i even knew what it was before watching it but it was still shocking i remember i kept thinking about it for days.
       Another thing i haven't mentioned is the action the hallway scene is amazingly choreographed in one long take its just so good overall, 
       this movie is really good and I'd give it a 5/5</strong></p>

      <h2>the man from nowhere</h2>
      </p><strong>The man from nowhere is a good movie. But i didn't enjoy it as much as i thought i would've probably because before that i watched oldboy and I've seen john wick so for me it kinda felt Samey but i still liked it and the action was really good. 
      The scene where the main character Tae-shik gets ready and puts on the suit was rally good. 
      overall 3/5 for me it's good but i couldn't get into it.</strong></p>

      <h2>Beyond the infinite two minutes</h2>
   <p><strong>Beyond the infinite two minutes is a really cool concept and it's a pretty good movie. I love the way this movie is shot. 
    The fact that this whole movie is in one long take is really cool. And the time travel is really well written. 
    It's a good simple movie I'd give it a 4/5.<strong><p>

      <h2>Extreme Job</h2>
      <p><strong>Extreme job is a comedy that actually got me to laugh. I love the way the humor is written and the whole concept of the movie. Is executed really well. The characters are well written and i like the way they bounce off of each other. 
        The fight scenes in this movie are also really well done. Overall this movie is a 4/5</strong> </p>

      <h2>A Minecraft Movie</h2>
      <p><strong>The Minecraft movie isn't a good movie. That's kinda it. I went to go see this in theaters and the theater experience was really good. 
        Everyone was shouting and screaming but the actual movie it's self isn't that good. Most of the characters are pretty forgettable besides Steve and Jason momoa.
        Along with that the movie goes by really quick it feels like every 10-20 seconds something new is happing. 
        It isn't the worst movie I've watched i liked watching it but i feel if i where to watch it again by my self it wouldn't be that good. 
        So overall 2/5</strong></p>

        Every frame of this movie looks amazing and the story is also really well told. 
        I enjoyed it alot but i felt that i couldve enjoyed it more. But even still i'd give it a 4/5

     <P><strong>interstellar is an amazing movie.i didnt think i'd like this movie that much. But i was very wrong this movie was so good. 
      I love the story and coopers relashonship with murphy is really well done. The acting is incdible. 
      And the twist at the end where it's revealed that cooper is murphy's ghost is really good. 
      Another thing i like is the visual effects are reslly good i love the black hole it looked so good.

      <h2>Dune part 1</h2>
      <P><strong>Dune is a really good movie. I've never read the books. So i wasn't sure i was going to like this type of movie since it's a lot of information. 
        But it's really good. I love the cinematography and every scene looks so good. I really liked Paul atreides i think his character was really well written. 
        Overall this movie was really good and even with all the information to take in this movie was good. 5/5<strong></P>

      <h2>Dune part 2</h2>
      <P><strong>Dune Part two is a really good movie and to be honest i think it's better then the first one. The cinematography in this one was amazing every shot looks gorgeous and the score is incredible. 
        I really liked Paul's character in the first movie. And in the second part i like his character even more. He reminds me a lot of Eren yeager from Attack on titan with his permissions into the future. 
        I loved the scene where he goes to the council and gives his speech. It's such a good scene. Another scene i really like is the start of the battle against the emperor. 
        When they ride the giant sand worms into the army of men and when Paul leads the fremen into the battle are such good scenes. Overall this movie is amazing I'd give it a 5/5<strong></P>
