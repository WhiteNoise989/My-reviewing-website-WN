      <h2>Frieren: Beyond Journey's End</h2>
      <p><strong>Frieren Beyond Journey's End is a show that i think if you haven't seen it already you absolutely should
       .Frieren follows the journey of an elven mage who, after defeating the Demon King with her party of heroes, begins to face the reality of her long lifespan compared to her human companions. 
        As centuries pass and her friends age and die, Frieren embarks on a new journey to understand the meaning of friendship, mortality, and the human experience. 
        This concept alone got me interested in the show. And when i stared to watch it i could see why its one of the highest rated anime on MAL. 
        The animation, The story, The characters are all amazing and that's me even mentioning the sound track. 
        The soundtrack is for this show is incredible. The animation is amazing it looks hand drawn almost and some shots like in ep 25 are works of art. 
        Overall I'd definitely give it a 5/5 i highly recommended this show</strong>.</p>

    <div class="review-text">
      <h2>Attack on Titan</h2>
      <p><strong> Attack on Titan is one of my favorite shows of all time. Out of every anime that's on this list Aot is my favorite.
         I genuinely think if you have watched anime and still haven't watched this show yet you are doing yourself a disservice. The story is incredible with so many great moments
        and plot twists. Such as the Reiner and Berthold reveal, Eren Causing the Rumbling, Levi vs the Beast Titan i could keep going on and on. 
        But honestly this show is a masterpiece and this is one of the few shows that i love. So overall I'd definitely give it a 5/5 Stars </strong>.</p>

    <div class="review-text">
      <h2>Solo Leveling</h2>
      <p><strong>Solo Leveling isn't like Aot or Frieren. The story isn't the most complex or have insane plot twists the characters aren't the most deep or Meaningful
        .But what this show does have is Hype moments. Not that the other two shows dont but Solo leveling is different
        .When i started watching this show i knew that it was popular and that it had good moments but i still wasn't sure that was until ep 4 where sung jin woo fights a massive snake 
        and that ep is what really got me into solo leveling along with that the concept of leveling up overtime.
        Eventually i finished  season 1 and started season 2 and i gotta say season 2 is even better then season 1 the first 1-3 ep of season 2 are so good the fights, the voice acting 
        it's all really good and the end of season 2 where Jin-woo Fights the ant king is incredible overall i'd give solo leveling a 4.5/5<strong></p>

    <div class="review-text">
      <h2>Jujutsu Kaisen</h2>
      <p><strong>Jujutsu Kaisen is a show that i like a lot its very different from other Shonen. In its power system, Characters and fights. 
        Which i like a lot i like the fact that its very unique. 
        The other thing i like a lot about this show is the fights. Jujustsu Kaisen is how you do fights in anime. My favorite has to be Yuji vs Mahito in season 2 Sukuna vs Mahoraga and Gojo vs The Disaster curses. 
        All of these fights are incredible. And what makes these fights so good is the power system. The power system of this show is great. Every time we see a domain expansion it means something. 
        Because only the highest Grade sorcerers can do it. Another thing I'll mention is the animation. The animation for these fights is amazing. 
        Its the reason why i like the fights i listed its because they look so good. I really like this show and i think it gets to much unnecessary hate. I'd give it a 4/5</strong></p>

    <div class="review-text">
      <h2>Naruto</h2>
      <p><strong>I’ll preface this by saying I’ll only be covering the og Naruto not Shippuden since I haven’t fully watched the show. 
        Regardless I think Naruto is a great show it was one of the first anime’s I watched and remember what I felt while watching it. 
        The fights were amazing and I liked the simplicity of it. Getting to learn about the power system, Characters and story. 
        The sasuke retrieval arc is one of my favorite arcs in the show and overall it's just a really good show so it's a 4/5</strong></p>

    <div class="review-text">
      <h2>One punch man</h2>
      <p><strong>One punch man is a really good show. I watched it a while ago but I think it still holds up. 
        The story is quite simple due to it being a comedy but It still has really good moments like Garou vs the 8 heros, Saitama vs Boros and Saitama vs Genos. 
        The animation for all of these fights was really good especially Saitama vs Boros. The one thing I didn't like was season 2 the animation for that season wasn't the best in my opinion. 
        I'm looking forward to season 3 and hope it won't be as bad as season 2 overall I'd give it a 3/5

    <h2>Kaguya sama love is war</h2>
    <p><strong>Kaguya Sama love is war. Is a show that should be way more popular then it already is. This show (And manga) is really good and one of the better romance shows I've seen now granted I haven't seen many but still. 
      The characters in this show are very likable and well written and the comedy in this show is also very well written and actually funny at some points. 
      The two main characters Kaguya and Shirogane and very well written and the comedy of them over thinking and making plans are great.
       As for the side characters like Ishigami, Chika and Iino they are also very well written and get alot more development and focus in the manga later on. 
       Overall I love this show it should be way more popular then it already is and is one of the few anime/ shows to actually make me cry so overall I'd give it a 5/5

    <img src="Csm.jpg" alt="Chainsaw Man" class="anime-image">
    <div class="review-text">
      <h2>Chainsaw Man</h2>
      <p><strong> Chainsaw Man isn't like most Shonen anime. This anime is just weird but it's also really good. The main character Denji isn't like most main characters. 
        Most main characters have some sort of goal like wanting to be the hokage or killing every titan. Denji's main goal is to touch boobs and its great. This story is just so well written with so many weird and insane moments
        like in ep 8 where Denji and one of the side Characters Himeno kiss. But she ends up Throwing up inside his mouth. Stuff like that that make this show so different from any other show I've watched 
        and i think that demonstrates just howe good of a writer Fujimoto is. And the manga right now is really good with the introduction of the war and death devil. 
        Im excited to see where this story goes and I'm so excited for the bomb devil arc movie. This show is just really good and is in my top five anime. 5/5</strong></p>

  <img src="Dandadan.webp" alt="Dandadan" class="anime-image">
  <div class="review-text">
    <h2>Dandadan</h2>
    <p><strong> I'll start this off by saying i haven't watched the Dandadan anime. BUT i have read the manga and what i can say is that this show is really good. Dandadann was made by Yukinobu Tatsu and he was on Fujimotos team for Chainsaw man and it shows. 
      this show starts off in the weirdest way possible.Momo believes in ghosts but not aliens and Okarun believes in aliens but not ghosts. 
      In a bet to determine who is correct, the two decide to separately visit locations associated with both the extraterrestrial and the occult Momo visiting the former, and Okarun the latter. 
      Momo is abducted by a group of aliens and Okarun gets possessed by a spirit who takes over his body and takes his balls. 
      The rest of the show follows the both of them trying to get Okarun's balls back. This show is once again a show that is unlike anything I've seen and its great. 
      The chemistry between Okarun and momo is perfect and the other side characters like Jiji,vamola,Aira are also really good. Overall this show is really good and I'd give it a 4.8/5 </strong></p>

  <img src="Deathnote.jpg" alt="Deathnote" class="anime-image">
  <div class="review-text">
    <h2>Deathnote</h2>
    <p><strong>Death note is one of the first anime i watched and just like with Naruto it's really good. I really enjoyed the characters and the way the story progressed around Light and L. 
      Another thing i also think adds to the show is the music. L's theme is so good and both of the ops are really good overall I'd give it a solid 4/5</strong></p>

   <div class="review-text">
     <h2>Kaiju no.8</h2>
     <P><strong>Kaiju no.8 is a fairly simple show. It's about a guy that gets the powers of a Kaiju and that's basically it. And its pretty good 
      the fights are entertaining the animation is really well done and it's a show i enjoyed i don't really have to much to say I'm excited for season 2 so overall it's a 3/5 <strong></P>

  <img src="Windbreaker.jpg" alt="Windbreaker" class="anime-image">
  <div class="review-text">
    <h2>Windbreaker</h2>
    <p><strong> windbreaker is a show about delinquents beating each other up. And it's really good. Now I've only actually watched the first season i know the second season is still airing but I'm still going to give my thoughts on it. 
      windbreaker is a fairly simple delinquent show but unlike other delinquent anime the fights are actually good. My favorite part was the tournament arc and my favorite fight from that arc has to be Sakura vs togame the choreography for the fight was amazing. 
      Overall I'd give this show a 3/5 </strong></p>

    <div class="review-text">
      <h2>Bocchi the rock</h2>
      <p><strong>Bocchi the rock is up there with some of my favorite anime. It's a show that has great characters, comedy and music. And it's just a really good slice of life show.
         The music for one is incredible i love the music of this show my favorite songs have to be seishun complex, i cant sing a love song and That band. 
         The characters are also really good my favorite has to be ryo. Along with that the comedy is really good my favorite gag has to be in ep 11 where bocchi becomes a 3d model and gets thrown into some bricks.
         Overall I'd give this show 4/5</strong></p>

      <h2>My Deer Friend Nokotan</h2>
      <p><strong>My deer friend nokotan is a show that isn't my favorite but i also don't hate it. It's a comedy show that has some good moments but sometimes it does fall flat. 
        One thing i will say is that the op is really good. overall i don't have to much to say about the deer show so it gets a 2/5 I've seen worse but I've seen better </strong> </p>

    <div class="review-text">
      <h2>GravityFalls</h2>
       <p><strong>Gravity falls is the first non anime I'm going to review and i gotta say its really good. The characters are very likable and very well written. 
        Easily my favorite character is the main villain bill cypher i just love the way he acts and is just pure evil. 
        As for the story the story is really good with one of the best twists I've seen. Being that that the author of the journals is Ford pines. Stanly's twin brother. 
        Overall this show is great. I love the Mystery of it all and its just a really good show. 5/5 </strong> </p>

    <div class="review-text">
      <h2>Amphibia</h2>
      <P><strong>Amphibia is another Non anime I'll be reviewing and just like with Gravity falls it's really good. Season 1 was alright. Ep 20 was really good with Anne and Sasha finally reuniting and then fighting each other. 
        But season 2 was way better with the introduction of Marcy. And finally seeing them all together. 
        The final ep of season 2 was really good with Marcy literally getting impaled and the final ep of season 3 was amazing. 
        With the Trio returning to earth overall this show is really good 4/5 </strong> </P>

    <div class="review-text">
      <h2>Owlhouse</h2>
      <p><strong>Owl house is a really good show. It's very similar to amphibia but it's still really good the first season was pretty good. And the final ep was really good with Eda and Lilith fighting. 
        The animation for that was amazing. Season 2 was also really good with the introduction of my favorite character Hunter. The ending for that season was amazing with The main character Luz and her friends getting sent back to Earth. 
        As for the final season. The 3 eps we got where all really good and the final fight with belos was really good i think he makes for a really good villain up there with the likes of bill cypher 
        overall this show gets a 5/5 </strong> </p>
